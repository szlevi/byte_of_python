# Elõszó #

Python valószínûleg azon kevés programozási nyelvek egyike, amelyek egyszerre
egyszerûek és hatékonyak. Egyaránt jó mind kezdõknek, mind haladóknak valamint,
ami még fontosabb, Ptyhonban szórakoztató propgramozni. Ez a könyv
megpróbál segíteni ennek a remek nyelvnek az elsajátításában és megmutatja, 
hogyan oldjunk meg dolgokat gyorsan és fájdalommentesen - röviden 
ez a könyv "az ellenszer programozási problémáidra".

## Kinek íródott ez a könyv? ##

Ez a konyv serves as a guide or tutorial to the Python programming
language. It is mainly targeted at newbies. It is useful for
experienced programmers as well.

The aim is that if all you know about computers is how to save text
files, then you can learn Python from this book. If you have previous
programming experience, then you can also learn Python from this book.

If you do have previous programming experience, you will be interested
in the differences between Python and your favorite programming
language - I have highlighted many such differences. A little warning
though, Python is soon going to become your favorite programming
language!

## Történelem lecke ##

I first started with Python when I needed to write an installer for
software I had written called 'Diamond' so that I could make the
installation easy. I had to choose between Python and Perl bindings
for the Qt library. I did some research on the web and I came across
[an article by Eric S. Raymond](http://www.python.org/about/success/esr/),
a famous and respected hacker, where he talked about how Python had
become his favorite programming language. I also found out that the
PyQt bindings were more mature compared to Perl-Qt. So, I decided that
Python was the language for me.

Then, I started searching for a good book on Python. I couldn't find
any!  I did find some O'Reilly books but they were either too
expensive or were more like a reference manual than a guide. So, I
settled for the documentation that came with Python. However, it was
too brief and small. It did give a good idea about Python but was not
complete. I managed with it since I had previous programming
experience, but it was unsuitable for newbies.

About six months after my first brush with Python, I installed the
(then) latest Red Hat 9.0 Linux and I was playing around with KWord. I
got excited about it and suddenly got the idea of writing some stuff
on Python. I started writing a few pages but it quickly became 30
pages long. Then, I became serious about making it more useful in a
book form. After a *lot* of rewrites, it has reached a stage where it
has become a useful guide to learning the Python language.  I consider
this book to be my contribution and tribute to the open source
community.

This book started out as my personal notes on Python and I still
consider it in the same way, although I've taken a lot of effort to
make it more palatable to others :)

In the true spirit of open source, I have received lots of
constructive suggestions, criticisms and
[feedback](#who-reads-a-byte-of-python) from enthusiastic readers
which has helped me improve this book a lot.
